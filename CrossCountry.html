        <h1>Cross Country</h1><br>
    
    <p>Cross country is an intense sport designed to test speed, endurance, jumping ability, and training of the horse and rider. This competition takes place on a 3 - 4 mile course, with between 24 - 36 jumping obstacles. These obstacles are typically made of "natural" looking materials such as logs and bushes, but strange materials may be used to test the horse's bravery. In order to even attempt a high-level course of this nature, the horse must be quick-thinking, agile, fearless, and very skilled in getting out of difficult situations.</p>
    
    <p>In these competitions, the horse will gallop through the course as quickly as possible, navigating the various jumps and obstacles as they go. Some courses are design to test jumping ability, while others can aim at other skills like quick-thinking, flexibility, or speed. This sport can be very dangerous for those not properly trained. A horse spooking at the wrong moment or refusing a particular jump can result in the rider being thrown, trampled, or injured on an obstacle. Training starts slow, building up these skills one at a time, and competitions should never be attempted until the horse and rider are confident in their ability and syngergy.</p>
    
    <p>The winner of the cross-country competition is the rider who finishes the course in the fastest time with the fewest refusals. Many riders go for the gold in these competitions, but many of them never finish. In the video below, you can see some of the typical falls, slips, and refusals that we see in many cross country competitions.</p>
